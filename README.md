# MassPKXextractor
This small program is used to extract .pkx files from pokémon save files. It will look for all valid save files in a specified folder and extract all stored pokémon in another location. The idea for this application started on [this](https://projectpokemon.org/forums/forums/topic/40188-suggestion-massive-pokemon-file-extractor/) thread on ProjectPokémon forums.

Additionaly you can specify if you want to search in all sub-folders, and create specific folders per save file and box. This program should support all main series save files.
